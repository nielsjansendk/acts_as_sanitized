= Acts As Sanitized

Cleans up text data before it hits your database and, eventually, your users.
The goal is to reduce Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Install and forget.

The plugin can figure out which fields it needs to sanitize, or you can 
specify fields manually.  The former is highly recommended.  Schemas change.

== Usage

If you'd like the plugin to figure out which fields to sanitize:

 class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
   acts_as_sanitized
 end
 
If you'd like to specify the fields to sanitize:

 class Entry < ActiveRecord::Base
   acts_as_sanitized :fields => [ :title, :body ]
 end
 
If you'd like to strip all HTML tags, not just script and form:

 class Review < ActiveRecord::Base
   acts_as_sanitized :strip_tags => true
 end
 
If you'd like to use all the fancy options at once:

 class Message < ActiveRecord::Base
   acts_as_sanitized :fields => [ :content ], :strip_tags => true
 end
 
== Known Issues

- 12 Jan 2007: test schema is generated twice when running tests.  Not harmful.
